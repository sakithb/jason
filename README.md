# Jason
Jason is a general purpose virtual assistant written in Python. Jason started as a fun side project and I was able to finish it. The project was created in 2017 though it was uploaded on github in 2021. Please excuse the amatuerness of my code (I was 15 years old and a beginner at the time). I don't intend to maintain this project any longer.

# Setting up
Install the requirements.txt file with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Important
- Please use a earlier version than python 3.8 (python 3.6 recommended)
- Only works on windows
